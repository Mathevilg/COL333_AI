1. wrote the basic code for local search and template is ready ! However answers need to be matched with others too. The code have to be made time sensitive, write now is taking 100 iterations to find the optimal, also time complexity needs to be analysed and other heuristics have to be selected for optimisation !




### 27/08 
1. Now have to change only in local search and have to discuss ideas. The functions like generate random permutation etc have to be implemented so that they are working at full optimality.
many answers were tested on many trestcases local search with random restart is runnign well enough !
However the implementation for time have to be matched !


2. For parth:
A code to automate the reult analysis is to be created so that we can keep track of how the outputs are coming out each time in order to find the optimal soln 

One such ordering could be (to be written in excel !)

Testcase No  ||   Some prop. of TC  ||  Model implemeted comments or date and time pushed to git || Output || iterations taken !
